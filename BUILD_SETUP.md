# Build Setup for TradeTracker Web

This project now uses Tailwind CSS with a proper build process instead of the CDN version.

## Setup Instructions

### Local Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development mode (watches for CSS changes):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will:
   - Watch `style.css` for changes and compile to `dist/style.css`
   - Start a local HTTP server on `http://localhost:8888`

3. **Manual build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This compiles `style.css` → `dist/style.css` once

### Production Deployment (Netlify)

The `netlify.toml` is configured to automatically:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build CSS: `npm run build`
3. Publish the root directory

No additional setup needed - just push to your repository!

## File Structure

- `style.css` - Source CSS file with Tailwind directives and custom styles
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind configuration (theme extensions)
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
- `dist/style.css` - Compiled CSS (generated by build process)
- `package.json` - Dependencies and build scripts
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify deployment configuration

## What Changed

- ✅ Removed Tailwind CDN script from HTML
- ✅ Added proper Tailwind build tooling
- ✅ Custom styles moved to `style.css`
- ✅ Netlify configured to build on deploy
- ⚠️ First Netlify build may take longer due to `npm install`

## Notes

- The `dist/` folder is generated during build and should not be committed
- All Tailwind utilities remain available with full customization
- Build size is much smaller than CDN version
